# 🖥️ Data-Structures 

Data-Structures is a repository for keeping my project assigned during **Laboratory of Algorithms and Data Structures** course at Università di Napoli Federico II.
Both of my assignments are developed in C.

## ​📌​ Suggestions 

I suggest to try both of the project in a Windows environment (as I was asked to)

## 🦠 ​First Assignment: Molecular Test for Covid-19 ​

The goal of this assignment was to implement a management system for molecular COVID-19 tests.\
This system was designed to serve both patients and doctors. In particular:
- **Patients** could sign up and log into the system using their social security number and a password. After logging in, they could request an appointment, check its current status, and view the outcome of their test.
- **Doctors** ccould sign up and log in using their work code and a password. Once logged in, they had access to the full history of molecular tests, could review patient requests, and manually add or cancel appointments.
This system also has a section where users could check the social security number of everyone who tested positive.

This project aimed to strengthen proficiency in using linked list and files in C.\
It was not asked to create a system for storing credential safely, so it was all stored in files.\
The outcomes of the tests were assigned randomly.\
For more implementation details you can refer to the [documentation]("Assignement 1"/Report_VincenzoMarotta_N863005.pdf) in italian, where it's also possible to find a How To Use.

## 🏝️ Second Assignment: I-Eats​
This is the second and final assignment called Island Delivery
