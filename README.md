# 🖥️ Data-Structures 

Data-Structures is a repository for keeping my project assigned during **Laboratory of Algorithms and Data Structures** course at Università di Napoli Federico II.
Both of my assignments are developed in C.

## ​📌​ Suggestions 

I suggest to try both of the project in a Windows environment (as I was asked to)

## 🦠 ​First Assignment: Molecular Test for Covid-19 ​

The goal of this assignment was to implement a management system for molecular COVID-19 tests.\
This system was designed to serve both patients and doctors. In particular:
- **Patients** could sign up and log into the system using their social security number and a password. After logging in, they could request an appointment, check its current status, and view the outcome of their test.
- **Doctors** ccould sign up and log in using their work code and a password. Once logged in, they had access to the full history of molecular tests, could review patient requests, and manually add or cancel appointments.
This system also has a section where users could check the social security number of everyone who tested positive.

This project aimed to strengthen proficiency in using linked list and files in C.\
It was not asked to create a system for storing credential safely, so it was all stored in files.\
The outcomes of the tests were assigned randomly.\
For more implementation details you can refer to the [documentation](Assignment%201/Report_VincenzoMarotta_N863005.pdf) in italian, where it's also possible to find a How To guide.

## 🏝️ Second Assignment: I-Eats​
This is the second and final assignment called I-Eats.\
The goal of this assignment was to create a management system for drivers working for a transport company in an archipelago. Every truck has a weight and a driver but the bridges connecting the island can only support a limited amount of weight while being crossed (min 600, max 3300).\
Every driver could:
- sign up and log into the system using their credentials. While signing up the driver was required to specify the weight of his truck.
- once logged in, the driver could select the food items to be transported to another island from a predefined list. The weight of the selected items had to be added to the truck's total load before starting the shipment.

The goal was to take the food from I<sub>starting</sub> to I<sub>destination</sub> using the shortest route that can support the truck weight.

The aim of this project was to strengthen proficiency in graphs and their algorithms, in particular **Dijkstra's algorithm**.
For more implementation details you can refer to the [documentation](Assignment%202/Report_Gruppo3.pdf) in italian where it's also possible to find an How To guide.
It's also possible to find a [scheme](Assignment%202/island_gruppo3.jpg) where are present all the islands and all bridges capacity.
