Data-Structures is a repository for keeping my project assigned during Laboratory of Algorithms and Data Structures course at Universit√† di Napoli Federico II.
Both of my assignments are developed in C.

## Suggestions 

I suggest to try both of the project in a Windows environment (as I was asked to)

## First Assignment: Molecular Test for Covid-19
